# these are icons at the top of the GUI that display a players stats and their values,
# for the stat use the exact EcoSkills/stats filename without .yml (e.g. "mining_fortune.yml" becomes "mining_fortune")
# If none of your icons are loading, double-check the stat names

# For player's name use %playername%
# For player's skull use PLAYER_HEAD
# Use & for formatting codes

# exampleIcon1:
#   material: PLAYER_HEAD
#   name: "&c%playername%'s Stats"
#   slot: 2
#   stats:
#     - mining_fortune
#     - lumber_fortune
#     - crit_chance
